# ML-classification-problem-diabetes-data
The goal with this project is to make some first steps into the world of machine learning. 
Currently this algorithm reaches an accuracy of about 55% which is a success for me personally but still there is a lot of learning and improvement to do here. I would appreciate any comments or help.
